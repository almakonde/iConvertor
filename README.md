Project name is a iConverter that allows: 
1. to choose one of the Measure type, correspondanting to the Serials {Degrees: Fahrengeit, Celsius; Length: km, m, sm, inch, yard, foot; Weight: kg, g, ounce, pound, tone; Time: minutes, seconds, milliseconds}, 
2. to insert Value in the Input field, 
3. to press Button "Calculate" and obtain the result of the Convertation.

English measurement systems are calculated using the following factors:
Inch (in) = 25.4 mm (2.54 cm)
Feet (ft) = 0.3048 m (or 12 inches)
Yard (yard) = 0.9144 m (or 3 feet)
Ounce (ounce, oz) = 28.35 g
Pound (lb) = 453.59 g (or 16 oz)

TO DO List

Persectives for improvements:

1) enlarge with more measure types, 
2) include Menu for the range of Measures,
3) distinguish on the interface the Serials (Time, Weight, Length, etc...),
4) rewrite the enumerators arguments in conversations in SetConvertType,
5) evaluate more possible solutions in code organization for more incapsulation and abstraction layers with less connections.
