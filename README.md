TO DO List

Persectives for improvements:

1) Add more measure types, 
2) Include Menu for the range of Measures,
3) distinguish on the interface the Serials (Time, Weight, Length, etc...),
4) Rewrite the enumerators arguments in conversations in SetConvertType,
5) evaluate more possible solutions in code organization for more incapsulation.
